REVIEW:
Do you like cowboys and space? Well it turns out that mixing the two was an absolutely awful idea, but here's a game about both anyways.

OVERVIEW/DESCRIPTION:
In [Insert title here] your task is to round up as many planets as possible before crashing into the sun. [Insert Title] 
is a very simplistic game where your controls consist of slowing down your asteroid as you barrel towards your impending 
doom within a [black hole] or yelling YEEHAW! because you feel like it. Left Click slows down your asteroid, Right Click
yells YEEHAW! Use the ability to slow down your asteroid to collect more planets as they fly by!
